        <section id="PersonalInfo">
            My name is Gjokica Stojanovski.I was raised in a small rural town in New Hampshire
            that is part of what’s known as the Upper Valley, a cluster of small towns
            and villages in both New Hampshire and Vermont that are divided by the Connecticut River.
            The city of Lebanon, like many small New England towns included in the “UV”, contains
            a rich history deriving from its early colonial settlement and the presence of Dartmouth
            College attend Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio.

        <section id="Earlycareer">
            My relationship with the guitar began in high school at the suggestion of my high school
            guidance counselor. I was lacking enough credits to graduate, and was feeling disillusioned
            with high school, my classes and American culture in general.
